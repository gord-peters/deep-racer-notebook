# Notes About My DeepRacer Setup

## Motivation

In June 2022, I attended an AWS Summit and had a chance to learn about and build a model for DeepRacer. I was struck by how it made a complex topic (Machine Learning) simple, approachable, and fun. I felt it would be a perfect way to introduce my autistic son and his classmates, most of whom have a keen interest in technology, to it.

I realized that the cost of iterating on models and training them could get prohibitively expensive for an entire class, so I looked into a way to train them using a local computer. That lead me to the DeepRacer local training project(s) and the community around it.

## Setup

### Hardware

I had an old Mac Pro (MacPro3,1) gathering dust and thought it would make an ideal training machine since it was designed to be run 24/7 (has server-grade hardware and good cooling). It only had 6GB of RAM and mechanical hard drives, so I bought another 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for it.

### Software
